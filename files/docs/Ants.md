# Ants and Bees

## Do I need to append `Ant` on every method

Yes, even on long names(so one is forced to limit number of words).

Sole exception are those `ants` that are inside `mini` folder

## Additional rules

- Prepend with underscore if the file contains data

- Short name of method suggests that it is either local method or it is mini `ant`
