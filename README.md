## Naming conventions

I admit the naming of the themes seems dubious. I just replaced foo, bar, baz with their equally irrelevant substitutes.

```
group themes by background:


`Advanced` for bright early day themes

`Brave` for mild themes

`Circus`  for darker mild themes

`Niketa` for after sunset themes
```

## Name

Niketa is the name I gave to my dog. On this picture, she is about 90 days:

## Develop

I build the themes by running `createPalleteTheme.spec.js` with `publish` flag set to `false`. I change some colors and then I enter debug mode.

Debug mode will open 22 themes, so the developer can choose which variation looks the best.

## Dark themes

I work around people which prefer dark themes. This set of themes is focused on light themes, but the themes factory is used to generate a few dark themes under `Because` namespace. All of them are published as standalone themes and are not part of the packaged `Niketa` theme.

- BesauseAlways

## Roadmap April 2019

[x] Dark themes are not uploaded here, but still published to mono repo

[x] Allow [OPACITY, COLOR] to actually generate gradient

[x] script to copy theme to mono repo folder

[x] opacity colors can still be darken

[x] Once new generate pallete theme is done, move the test to deprecated as this will pin the palletes  

[x] Generated palletes just change COLOR_1 to COLOR_5

[x] Generate uniq set of COLOR_0 till COLOR_5 for pallete bases

[x] Each theme is also a separate published theme

[x] Dark theme based on `90s` theme

[x] Use lerna for monorepo

[x] get max levels ant(as instead of 22 we call this ant)

[x] increase dev theme levels from 22

[X] LIGHTEST fix

[x] Set React, Jest, JSON, JS folder in data to test out themes

[] Fix readme dark as it is not deleted on publish and has wrong image path

[] Change dark theme from mono repo
