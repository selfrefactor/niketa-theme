## Naming conventions

I admit the name of the themes seems too lazy. This is on purpose as my goal is to generate useful light themes, not to create meaningful names.
I did it as if I were a jazz musican, i.e. totally nonsense.

```
group themes by background:


`Advanced` for bright early day themes

`Brave` for mild themes

`Circus`  for darker mild themes

`Niketa` for after sunset themes
```

## Name

Niketa is the name I gave to my dog. On this picture, she is about 90 days:
