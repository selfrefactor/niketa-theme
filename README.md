# Niketa

Dark/Light VSCode Theme

Huge collection of dark and light themes. Most of the themes are imported from other themes. The reasoning is the following.

I change my themes many times per day, sometimes even 20. I do that randomly and that is why I cannot have a theme that I don't like.

For example `Rainglow` theme suite has over 150 themes. It will be very hard for me to switch to the few ones that I actually fancy. 

Other case is that a theme has additional option `italic` and that creates two themes to choose from. I don't have usage for the `italic` feature so to me it is just a noise I have to avoid. In this case I import only the default option.

## Screens

As there are over 50 themes inside `Niketa`, it is heavy task to publish all the possible screens. That is why I share only few of them:

## Name

Niketa is the name I gave to my dog. On this picture, she is about 90 days:
