## Naming conventions

I admit the name of the themes seems too lazy. This is on purpose as my goal is to generate useful light themes, not to create meaningful names.
I did it as if I were a jazz musican, i.e. totally nonsense.

## Name

Niketa is the name I gave to my dog. On this picture, she is about 90 days:
